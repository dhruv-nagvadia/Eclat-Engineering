# JavaScript Basics and Practice

This repository contains JavaScript exercises to help you understand key programming concepts and practice essential skills used in web development.

## Concepts Covered

- **Data Types & Variables**: Working with strings, numbers, and booleans.
- **Template Literals**: Embedding variables in strings.
- **Functions**: Regular and arrow functions, recursion.
- **Arrays**: Manipulating arrays with methods like `push()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
- **Objects**: Creating and accessing objects, iterating over properties.
- **Loops**: `for`, `for...of`, `for...in` loops for iteration.
- **Algorithms**: Factorial, Fibonacci, and palindrome checks.

## Code Snippets

- **String Manipulation**: Using template literals for variable insertion.
- **Array Operations**: Adding/removing elements with `push()`, `pop()`, and more.
- **Object Handling**: Creating and modifying objects.
- **Loops**: Iterating over arrays and objects with various loops.
- **Sum and Max**: Calculating sum and max of array elements.
- **Frequency Counting**: Counting occurrences of letters/words in a string.
